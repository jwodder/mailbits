"""
Assorted e-mail utility functions

``mailbits`` provides a small assortment of functions for working with the
Python standard library's ``Message``/``EmailMessage``, ``Address``, and
``Group`` types, as well as a couple other features.  It can parse & reassemble
Content-Type strings, convert instances of the old ``Message`` class to the new
``EmailMessage``, convert ``Message`` & ``EmailMessage`` instances into
structured ``dict``\\s, parse addresses, format address lists, and extract
recipients' raw e-mail addresses from an ``EmailMessage``.
